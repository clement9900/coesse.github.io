      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To encourage reflection on the dignity of life and humanity’s
        responsibility toward the Earth — not through authority,
        but through individual awareness.

    <!-- VISION -->
    <section class="card">
      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>
        A world where human dignity is respected,
        the Earth is treated as a living system,
        and responsibility begins with each individual.

        <h3>Life Is Interconnected</h3>
        <p>
          The Earth is not merely a resource,
          but a shared system of life.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Human Dignity</h3>
        <p>
          Dignity is inherent and unconditional,
          independent of power or identity.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Individual Responsibility</h3>
        <p>
          Meaningful change begins quietly,
          with personal awareness.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Reflection Before Action</h3>
        <p>
          Without reflection, action loses direction.
