      <h1>One World. One Breath.</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        Coesse is an initiative emerging from volunteers, rooted in a shared concern
        for life, human dignity, and the future of the planet.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        This is not an organization.<br>
        It is a shared moment of reflection.

    <!-- Reflection -->
    <section class="glass reflection">
      <p>
        We live in a time of acceleration.
        Information moves faster than understanding.
        Action often precedes care.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coesse exists as a pause within that motion.
      </p>
      <p>
        A reminder that human dignity is not granted by systems,
        and that the Earth does not belong to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Responsibility begins quietly,
        within individuals,
        before it ever becomes visible.
      </p>

    <!-- What This Is -->
    <section class="glass section">
      <h2>What This Is</h2>
      <p>
        Coesse exists as a quiet effort shaped by individuals who believe that
        the dignity of life and the condition of the Earth cannot be separated.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not claim authority.
        We do not represent institutions, governments, or ideologies.
        We do not speak on behalf of others.
      </p>

    <!-- Core Beliefs -->
    <section class="beliefs">
      <div class="glass card">
        <h3>Life Is Interconnected</h3>
        <p>The Earth is not merely a resource, but a living system in which all life is connected.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="glass card">
        <h3>Human Dignity Comes First</h3>
        <p>Every person possesses inherent dignity, independent of nationality, belief, or status.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="glass card">
        <h3>Responsibility Is Individual</h3>
        <p>Change does not begin with structures, but with personal awareness and responsibility.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="glass card">
        <h3>Care Precedes Action</h3>
        <p>Without care, action becomes noise. Without reflection, movement loses meaning.</p>

    <!-- Why This Exists -->
    <section class="glass section">
      <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
      <p>The world does not suffer from a lack of voices, but from a lack of attention.</p>
      <p class="emphasis">Not to lead.<br>Not to persuade.<br>Not to mobilize.<br><br>But to pause.</p>
